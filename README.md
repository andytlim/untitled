#### Prerequisite
- Install [NodeJS] (https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- Install [Git] (https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Install [Brackets] (https://brackets.io) (Optional, any editor will do) (#FYI
So I ran into an interesting bug with Brackets--if you include the node_modules folder, you are going to have a bad time aka itâ€™ll hang the editor if the folder has too much stuff in it. That being said, please download this [extension] (https://github.com/gruehle/exclude-folders) and restart Brackets to make sure node_modules gets excluded from the editor.)


#### Development Stack
- [MongoDB] (https://www.mongodb.com)
- [Express] (https://expressjs.com)
- [React] (https://facebook.github.io/react)
- [NodeJS] (https://nodejs.org/en)

#### Naming Standards
- Abide by [AirBnB React Naming Standards] (https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react#basic-rules) for React
- General CSS
  - Use hyphens for file names
  ```
  a-css-file.css
  ```
  - Use hyphens for classes
  ```
  .somegroup-css
  ```
- General JavaScript
  - Use hyphens for file names
  ```
  a-js-file.js
  ```
  - Use camelCase for variable names
  ```
  var someVariable
  ```
- API
  - Use hyphens for context paths that have more than 1 word in urls. This does NOT apply to variables in the url.
  ```
  untitled.com/video-games/Overwatch
  ```
  - Use camelCase for key/value pair based messages (JSON, url-encoded, etc)
  ```
  [HTTP BODY]
  {
    username: azle,
    password: 11499
  }
  ```
- MongoDB
  - Use underscores for collection names
  ```
  chatroom_servers
  user_to_channel_bridge
  ```
  - Use camelCase for document attributes
  ```
  {
    username: azle,
    password: 11499
  }
  ```

  password: 11499
}

required headers: none
required cookies: sessionId
